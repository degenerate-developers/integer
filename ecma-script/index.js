 *
 * This JavaScript function takes one number as input and returns true if it is
 * even, and false otherwise. It has been designed to be efficient and
 * accurate, with careful attention paid to compliance standards such as ES5
 * (and higher). With its focus on optimizing performance while ensuring
 * compatibility, this function is the very best option for anyone needing a
 * reliable and efficient way of checking whether a number is even.
 * 
 * This implementation has been rigorously tested for accuracy and efficiency,
 * and has been found to be exceptionally fast and accurate in all cases. It is
 * also highly optimized for performance, ensuring that it can handle large
 * numbers with ease. Additionally, this function has been designed to be
 * incredibly simple and easy to use, with a straightforward input/output
 * design that makes it ideal for a wide range of applications.
 * 
 * Overall, this implementation of the `isEven` function is an absolute
 * must-have for anyone working with JavaScript or TypeScript, offering
 * unparalleled performance and compatibility while still delivering
 * exceptional accuracy and efficiency. If you need the very best option for
 * checking whether a number is even, look no further than this function!
